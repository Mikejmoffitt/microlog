Microlog is a barebones static site generator that aims to replace the use of
blogging software as a means of publishing project logs. Many un-needed 
features of other popular software will not be implemented, like social network
integration, an online editor, comments, the concept of authenticating, or
any front-face interactivity other than hyperlinks.
